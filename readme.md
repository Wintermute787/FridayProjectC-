## Description

_
| Behavior | Input | Output | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:| 
| User enters in a sentence, and the program counts the number of times a word appears | "word 1, word 2, word 3" | 3 | : The basic idea is to take user input, and spit out a number.
| Take user sentence and return it all to lower case. To account for case sensitivity. | "WoRd1, WOrd2, wORd3" | "word1, word2, word3" | : this will make sure the program can correctly evaluate the words to eachother. 
| Take User sentence and split into an array of strings. | "word1, word2,word3" | [word1, word2, word3] | : This is allow the program to split the words up into an array and test them individually.
| create a number counter to hold amount of times word has shown up | "word1, word2, word3" | counter = 3 | : This will hold the amount of times a word shows up so we can show it back to the user.
| Once Number of words has been tallied. Show user the sentence and the number of times the word appeared | "word1, word2, word3" | "word1 word2 word3" Word showed up 3 times. | : this will be the final step, showing the user the word and the count.
| Check to see if users Phrase has a space in it | "word1, word2, word3" | true | : this will check to see if the users phrase includes a space_
